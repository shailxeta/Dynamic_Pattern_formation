Dynamic_Pattern_formation
=========================



In this project, three robots are searching for food in two rooms seperated by a wall.
There is a space in wall for going to other room. The space is dynamic i.e. space can be anywhere throughout the wall.
When the Robots found food they make triangle and try to get the food. If the position of food changes then they again find food into two rooms.
To go in other room they try to find way(space)through wall. If they found enough space to pass triangle then they directly come to other room without changing there shape otherwise they come in Line.
Once they got food they make circle around it.

This program is same for all three NXT's. Each NXT has a name in variable my_name (1,2,3) and variable leader says who is leader currently.


SHAPES to be formed :
1) Triangle

2) Line

3) Circle


NOTE : Python image server is also included with this code.
